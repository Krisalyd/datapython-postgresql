# python-postgresql-connection
Creating a connection between Python and PostgreSQL to insert data into a table. 

This small personal project is the first one i ever made, keeping in mind that my object is to develop my skills primarily in Python, but also trying to connect python with other technologies.

The functionality of this project is to establish a connection with my PostgreSQL server and insert data into the table I desire.
